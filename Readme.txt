How to use:

1. Sensor class can be used as a real world sensor object and can be initialized by instantiating its object.
    eg:
    Sensor s= new Sensor("Temperature",0,20,2000);
    
    Here "Temperature" is the friendly name given to sensor
    0 is the minimum value generated by sensor
    20 is the maximum value generated by sensor
    2000 is the samplingRate (means every 2 sec the value will get updated in the sensor)

2. Using this function a complex device with so many sensors or many sensors of same type can be simulated and developed


Application:
 1. Creating data for simulation environment.
 2. Simulating a device with lot of Sensors.
 3. Sensors of Same and different kind can be evaluated for simulation environment.
